Alot of games use music as a way to make their audience feel like they are playing a game. There are alot of different music in games but barely any have the genre of music called kpop. Kpop is highly influencial throughout the world most in the asain countries like Korea and China. Unfortunately it isnt as popular in other parts of the world like the US and the UK and most Caribbean countries. We can spread the influence of kpop through gaming.</p><br>
